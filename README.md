Vietnamese input method editor (IME) processing library for conversion of Vietnamese Telex input into correct orthographical output with diacritics.

Many thanks to the [vi-rs](https://github.com/ZeroX-DG/vi-rs) team, whose project has been essential in the making of this library. Not only has its well documented code been used as reference for this project, but parts of it have also been simply rewritten into Kotlin where needed.
